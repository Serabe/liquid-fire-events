# Liquid-fire-events

Provides a service that you can use to subscribe to 2 events from Liquid Fire:
`transitionBegan` and `transitionAnimated`.

Additionally, this addon provides a component `delayed-render` which
wraps a block of markup and only renders it after a transition has finished.
This is useful eg. to avoid rendering while animating, a common cause of jank
especially in mobile browsers.

Example usage:

```htmlbars
{{my-navigation-bar}}
{{! my-complex-component will not be rendered until the animation is complete}}
{{#delayed-render}}
  {{my-complex-component}}
{{/delayed-render}}
```
